The module is a kernel character device
It supports the following operations:

    .write		= ibwdt_write,
    .ioctl		= ibwdt_ioctl,
    .open		  = ibwdt_open,
    .release	= ibwdt_close,

## Write Operation

The write operation takes as input a file pointer but it is unused

It also takes a buffer and a count associated with the buffer

The operation modified the global `expect_close` based on the value in the
buffer

It also calls `ibwdt_ping` which writes `wd_margin` to the `WDT_START` port

No lock is held in the operation
